# Cocktail Flow :cocktail:

A Flutter project to design a Cocktail Flow App similar to the one on the apple/play store at [Cocktail Flow](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cocktail-flow-drink-recipes/id486811622)

## Getting Started

This project mimics the Cocktail flow application designed by [CocktailFlow](https://cocktailflow.com/). I Worked on replicating some of its functionality with the help of Flutter.

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Running project

Use `flutter run` to run the project.

Final application looks as follows:
